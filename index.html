            <h1>AI Engineer <span>Hai</span></h1>
            <p>
                Hello! I'm an AI Engineer with experience in developing AI-powered solutions, automation, and cloud-based systems. I specialize in machine learning, deep learning, and software optimization, reducing development time and improving efficiency. At Cinnamon AI, I built and maintained FSH systems for document extraction using Azure DI & LLM, created developer-friendly libraries, and automated AWS setup, reducing setup time by 90%. I also developed image labeling tools and led technical solutions for multiple client projects. Passionate about AI, cloud automation, and scalable ML solutions, I love building tools that make complex workflows easier.
